Getting started with TEVA
</b></font></table></table>
<p>
The NKI TE-VOICE ANALYSIS tool (TEVA) is a multi-platform stand-alone application. It is 
available for MS Windows, Apple Macintosh OSX, and Linux. It is also available as a separate interactive 
Praat script (<a href="http://www.praat.org" target="_blank">www.praat.org</a>).</p>
<h3>
Getting a copy of TEVA</h3>
<p>
TEVA is licensed under the <a href="TEVA_license.html">GNU GPLv2</a> and can be freely used and distributed. You can 
download a copy of TEVA from <a href="http://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/IFA-SpokenLanguageCorpora/NKIcorpora/NKI_TEVA/" target="_blank">www.fon.hum.uva.nl/IFA-SpokenLanguageCorpora/NKIcorpora/NKI_TEVA/</a> . TEVA 
can be saved on your hard disk or USB thumb drive and started by clicking on the icon.</p>
<h3>
The TEVA pages</h3>
<p>
After you start TEVA, a window will appear. This will initially contain the <i>Main</i> page. 
In normal practice, this is the page you will spend most of your time in. 
There is a second page which allows you to change the settings of the application, 
the <i>Configuration</i> page. You can turn pages using a button on the top right of each page 
(with an arrow symbol &#8594;).</p>
<p>
Each page contains a number of buttons. The <i>Main</i> page also contains a canvas which is used 
to draw the results of the analysis on. You interact with TEVA by clicking the buttons. For instance, 
at the top-right of the Main page, there is a <b>Quit</b> button labeled with a red <b></b><code>X</code> cross that will terminate the 
application when you click on it. While the TEVA application is busy processing whatever the click of a button 
asks it to do, the button will be grayed out (the label will be gray too instead of black or colored). 
While a button is grayed out, TEVA will not respond to other button clicks.</p>
<p>
Every button has a keyboard shortcut. This shortcut is generally a single character, one of the letters of the 
label on the button. That character will be printed in <i>italic</i> in the label. For instance, in English, the 
Quit button is labeled <b><i>Q</i>uit</b> (with an italic <i>Q</i>). Hitting the <b>Q</b> key (upper or lowercase) will terminate the program.</p>
<p>
You can change the size of the TEVA window just as you can with every other window on your desktop. 
However, you will notice that the positioning of the buttons and texts on the page will be off. 
Sometimes the windows will look completely scrambled. The page can be redrawn with the <b>Refresh</b> button 
or by hitting the <b>space bar</b>. Use the <b>space bar</b> when the page is so scrambled that you cannot click the 
<b>Refresh</b> button anymore.</p>
<p>
Each page contains a <b>Help</b> button. This button is labeled with a <b>?</b> question mark. Hitting the 
<b>?</b> or <b>/</b> key will start the interactive <b>Help</b> service. While <b>Help</b> is active, a single line of help text will 
appear whenever you click a button. Clicking the <b>Help</b> button again will stop the <b>Help</b> service. The help text 
for each button will include the keyboard shortcuts in the current language.</p>
<h3>

Here are descriptions of a few often used buttons for general use.

<h3>
Language support</h3>
<p>
TEVA supports a few languages, currently English, German, and Dutch. Extending this to other languages 
is rather easy (just translating a few dozen sentences). But it can only be done with the help of a native speakers of that language. 
Please contact us if you would like to help to port TEVA to your language.</p>
