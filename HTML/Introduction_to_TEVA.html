Introduction to TEVA
</b></font></table></table>
<p>
the NKI TE-VOICE ANALSYSIS tool (TEVA) is developed as a tool for use in education and research. 
TEVA is intended to help Speech Pathologists and other researchers to study 
the acoustic characteristics of TE speech and to allow them to 
get experience with the acoustic analysis of Tracheoesophageal (TE) speech.</p>
<h3>
Introduction</h3>
<p>
TEVA is built on top of the Praat phonetics software package (<a href="http://www.praat.org" target="_blank">www.praat.org</a>). As such  
TEVA presents a selection of the relevant analysis methods with an easy to use interface. 
The approach to the analysis of TE speech used in TEVA is based on the work of Corina van As-Brooks as described in her 
PhD thesis (<a href="Acoustic_Signal_Typing.html">Van As, 2001</a>).</p>
