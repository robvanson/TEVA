How to determine the <a href="Acoustic_Signal_Typing.html">pathological type and read the acoustic signal typing</a></p>
<p>
Record or Open an /a/ sound, select a stable part of the recording and add information 
about the speaker and recording:</p>

<h3>
Pathological type</h3>
<p>
A short description of the criteria to determine the pathological type is displayed 
when you click on the <i>Pathology</i> button on the <a href="Overview_of_Configuration_page.html">Configuration page</a>. 
It can also be found on the <a href="Acoustic_Signal_Typing.html">Acoustic Signal Typing</a> manual page.</p>
<p>
The criteria for the pathological typing are mostly impressionistic. This is about the ability 
of the speaker to produce a stable /a/ sound with many harmonics. This can be evaluated by listening 
to the sound, and looking at the <i>Spectrogram</i>. Inspection of the <i>Pitch</i> and <i>Harmonicity</i> displays will 
give extra information. </p>
<p>
When a voice has been evaluated and a type decided upon, the type can be entered by pressing 
one of the number keys, 1-4 for types I - IV. The types can always be changed. Pressing 0 will erase the 
type. The currently selected type will be printed over the display and stored in the table with speaker data.</p>
<h3>
Acoustic signal typing</h3>
<p>
There is also an <a href="AST_categories.html">automatic evaluation of pathological type</a>. The displays 
for <i>Pitch</i>, <i>Ltas</i>, and <i>Harmonicity</i> contain pathological type estimates preceded by "AST:" 
(<a href="Acoustic_Signal_Typing.html">Acoustic Signal Typing</a>) based on individual <a href="AST_categories.html">acoustic measures</a>. 
The median value of these measures is displayed in arabic numerals (1-4) as long as no pathological type has 
been entered by hand. Note that the automatic AST will only be calculated from measures for which the display 
has been shown (calculated). So it will change until all the relevant displays have been shown. 
The median AST will be calculated when a report is generated.</p>
