<p>
A tutorial example of how to evaluate the Acoustic Signal Typing in a corpus</p>
<h3>
Download and open the corpus</h3>
<p>
Download the corpus .zip file from [To be announced] and extract it to a convenient location. 
Open TEVA and then click the <i>Open</i> button on the <a href="Overview_of_Main_page.html">Main page</a>. A file selection window will 
open. Navigate into the map you just downloaded and select the assigned table file. Then click <i>Choose</i>. The 
<a href="Overview_of_Main_page.html">Main page</a> now contains a display of an empty sound.</p>
<h3>
Stepping through the Corpus</h3>
<p>
You will notice that after opening the Table file, some settings of TEVA have changed. The display type has changed to 
<i>Spectrogram</i>, with a range from 0-2kHz. The <i>Speaker</i> button at the bottom left has changed to a blue <i>Nxt</i> button. When you click 
on the <i>Nxt</i> button, a file will be loaded. If you just started, this will be the first file ([1] in the window title). 
If you already have worked on this project, the next file without an AST label will be displayed. Every time the <i>Nxt</i> button is 
clicked, the next file will be loaded. If you ever have to go to a different file than the next in the list, click on the <i>Settings</i> button 
to go to the <a href="Overview_of_Configuration_page.html">Configuration page</a> and click the <i>Serial</i> button (which should change from <i>red</i> to <i>black</i>). 
After that change, the <i>Speaker</i> button will reappear on the <a href="Overview_of_Main_page.html">Main page</a>. Use this button to display the required 
file.</p>
<h3>
Evaluate a recording</h3>
<p>
Use the <i>Spectrogram</i> (or another analysis display) to determine the <a href="Acoustic_Signal_Typing.html">Acoustic Signal Type</a>. You can 
click inside the display to indicate a window of interest and use the <i>Zoom</i> and <i>Select</i> panel to navigate through the recording. 
Help about signal typing can be found in the man pages (<a href="Acoustic_Signal_Typing.html">Acoustic Signal Typing</a>) or in the <i>Pathology</i> window on the 
<a href="Overview_of_Configuration_page.html">Configuration page</a>. After you have decided which pathological type you want to assign, just 
press the number key (one of 1-4). Press 0 to remove your choice. After that, you can press <i>Nxt</i> to go to the next recording.</p>
<h3>
Saving your work</h3>
<p>
To save your evaluations, click on the <i>Settings</i> button to go to the 
<a href="Overview_of_Configuration_page.html">Configuration page</a> and click the <i>Save</i> button (<i>not the</i> Save <i>button</i> on the 
<a href="Overview_of_Main_page.html">Main page</a><i></i>). A window will open which asks you where to save the Table. Select the file you opened 
before to replace the original Table. If you forget to save your work, TEVA will prompt you to save your work if you 
<i>Quit</i> or open another Table. If you ever leave TEVA without saving the Table file, you will find a <i>recovery file</i> next 
to the original file. This file has the same name as the original, but with a ~ added. Open this file and save it to replace the 
original to recover the "lost" work. Note that this recovery file will be removed if you open the original file and either 
change something, <i>Save</i> it again, or <i>Close</i> it.</p>
