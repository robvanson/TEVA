Example evaluating AST

<p>
A tutorial example of how to evaluate the Acoustic Signal Typing on a sample of recordings</p>
<h3>
Download and open the example corpus</h3>
<p>
Download the TEVA_AST_example.zip file from [To be announced] and extract it to a convenient location. 
Open TEVA and then click the <i>Open</i> button on the <a href="Overview_of_Main_page.html">Main page</a>. A file selection window will 
open. Navigate into the map you just downloaded and select <i>SignaltypeVoiceSamples.Table</i>. Then click <i>Choose</i>. The 
<a href="Overview_of_Main_page.html">Main page</a> now contains a display of an empty sound. <i>SignaltypeVoiceSamples.Table</i> 
contains data on a number of recordings. You must now select the recording you want to use.

<h3>
Select speakers</h3>
<p>
Click on the <i>Speaker</i> button (lower left). A new window will open. Click on the <b>=</b> button. 
You now see a table with 5 columns and 4 lines (enlarge the window if you do not see all of it). The headings 
read <i>ID</i>, <i>Text</i>, <i>Description</i>, <i>Audio</i>, and <i>AST</i>. Except for the <i>Description</i> column, all columns contain 
metadata for the recordings mentioned in the <i>Audio</i> column. Close the Info window and click in the TEVA window 
to view the Speaker window.</p>
<p>
The Speaker window has three text fields. The top one contains the ID of the recording, the next field 
a short description of the speaker (e.g., name or ID, age, sex, etc.). You can change this field, or even create 
it for a newly recorded voice. If you enter an ID, or just the start of the ID, or row number in the table, 
the corresponding speaker from the Info window will be read and displayed in TEVA. If you empty the ID field 
completely and replace it with a single dash <b>-</b>, the current record will be removed from the table.
</p> <p align=center>

<p>
Put a single <i>3</i> in the top field of the Sepaker window to select the third entry in the Table. 
Then Click the <i>Ready</i> button. You now see a display of the recording of the fourth speaker. You see the ID of this 
speaker and the <a href="Acoustic_Signal_Typing.html">Pathological Type</a> as it was recorded in the Table.</p>
<h3>
Find a stable interval</h3>
<p>
Inspect the recording using the <i>Sound</i> and <i>Spectrogram</i> windows. Then decide how the speech can be 
judged according to following statements as <i>Good</i>, <i>Mediocre</i>, or <i>Bad</i>. See also <a href="Acoustic_Signal_Typing.html">Acoustic Signal Typing</a></p>
<ul>
<li>
&nbsp;The speaker can keep a stable /a/ sound over more than 2 seconds
<li>
&nbsp;There are clear harmonics up to 1000Hz
<li>
&nbsp;There is at least one stable harmonic for longer than 2 seconds
<li>
&nbsp;There are harmonics in part of the sample, for longer than 1 second
</ul>
<p>
With these statments in mind, pick an interval where the vowel is most stable. You can use 
the <i>Zoom in</i> and <i>Zoom out</i> buttons as well as the <i>Previous</i> (move left) and <i>Next</i> (move right) buttons 
to navigate around.</p>
<p>
When you found a part that you think is most stable, select an interval of 200 ms. Click the <i>Select</i> button. 
You are now asked to click on the position in the display where you want the start of the interval. When you do that, 
a vertical blue line appears. Now you are asked to click on the position in the display where the end of the interval 
should come. Click there. Alternatively, you can simply click inside the display window to select the first boundary.
After that it proceeds as with the <i>Select</i> button. Make sure that the interval is at least 100 ms 
long. You can find the times of start and end points at the top of the graph. You can <i>Zoom in</i> or go <i>To selection</i>, 
but that is not necessary. </p>
<h3>
Acoustic analysis</h3>
<p>
Inspect the other displays, <i>Pitch</i>, <i>Ltas</i>, <i>Intensity</i>, and <i>Harmonicity</i>. Below each 
of these displays, analysis parameters will be printed about the selected interval (see also 
<a href="Analysis.html">Analysis</a> and <a href="AST_categories.html">AST categories</a>). Do these acoustic parameters support your evaluation of the preceding 
statements? Use the <i>Previous</i> (move left) and <i>Next</i> (move right) buttons to move the selected interval around 
and see how this affects the acoustic parameters. </p>
<h3>
Entering the Pathological Type</h3>
<p>
When you have decided what type of pathological voice the recording has, you simply push one of the numbers 
<i>1-4</i>, and the type is recorded. The type will be displayed in the window and in the title bar. Push <i>0</i> to remove 
the type.</p>
<h3>
Saving your work</h3>
<p>
After evaluating the sounds, the pathological types and remarks added to the Speaker Info table should be saved 
to disk. Go to the <a href="Overview_of_Configuration_page.html">Configuration page</a> and click on <i>Save</i>. Fill in the name you want the file 
to have (or use the default) and click <i>Save</i>. During the work, every change or addition made to the Speaker Info table 
is saved into a backup file with the same name as the original file and an added <b>~</b> character. When you <i>Save</i> or <i>Close</i> 
the table, this backup file is removed. Otherwise, it will remain until you open the table again and change something in it. 
If you accidently forgot to save the table, you can simply open the backup file and save it under the old, or a new, name.</p>
<p>
To save the complete analysis of a single recording, use the <a href="Saving_a_report.html">Save</a> button on the 
<a href="Overview_of_Main_page.html">Main page</a>. This will ask for a place and name to save a directory with all the displays and 
all the analysis data for the current time interval.</p>
