Creating a listening experiment

First, format an replacable storage medium, e.g., an USB thumbdrive and name it "TEVAexp".

On this replacable drive, create a file called "TEVAinit.tsv which contains the following lines with tab separated entries:

Key	Value
config.speakerData	./Stimuli.Table
config.language	NL
config.source	Original
config.speakerSerial	Forw
config.showBackground	0
config.muteOutput	0
config.ratingForm	Vowel
config.vasScaleTicks	0
mainPage.draw	Rating
te.rememberPreferences	0
te.ratingExperiment	1

You can change the config.language from "NL" to any other supported language (EN, DE, JA). You can select a Rating form other than "Vowel" (Text, INFVo, GRBAS).

Create a file called "Stimuli.tsv" like this (with tab separated columns):
ID	Text	Description	Audio
A	Sentence	S 1	Stimuli/{A_S1_1,beep,A_S1_2}.wav
B	Sentence	S 1	Stimuli/{B_S1_2,beep,B_S1_1}.wav
C	Sentence	S 1	Stimuli/{C_S1_1,beep,C_S1_2}.wav

The four columns contain, respectively, the ID code of the stimulus, the text that might be displayed, a description of the stimulus, and a path to the audio, starting at the map where the Stimuli.tsv file is stored. The content between the {}-brackets is split on ","-commas and and a file path is constructed with each of them. So, "Stimuli/{A_S1_1,beep,A_S1_2}.wav" in dicates three files:
Stimuli/A_S1_1.wav
Stimuli/beep.wav
Stimuli/A_S1_2.wav
These files are loaded and concatenated. The final result is a single audio file.
